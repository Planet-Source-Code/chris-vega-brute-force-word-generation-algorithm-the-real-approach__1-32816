### Description

This application sez what it does, i made it in Win32 Assembly back in 1998 for use in Game Crackings; and been using the same algo for years until i seen a lot of submissions in PSC about Brute-Forcing word generations, but those authors doesn't know what is a real fast Brute-Force Algo is? a friend of mine and i converted the Win32 Assembly Algo to Visual Basic (inspite of its limitations) and this was the result; hope you enjoy it and you find its usage? anyway, please leave vote or comment!
